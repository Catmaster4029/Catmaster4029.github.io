		<h1>Welcome to Web Lab!</h1>
		<h2>This is a web page</h2>
		<p>You are looking at an actual web page written in HTML, the language of the web. On the left side you can see the code used by your computer to create this page.</p>
		<h2>Inspector Tool</h2>
		<p>Use the Inspector tool to see what pieces of code are linked to what text on the web page. Go through it with a partner so you can discuss what you're seeing.</p>
		<h2>Discuss</h2>
		<p>With a friend discuss the following questions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What text is appearing in both the code and the web page?</li>
			<li>How is this language communicating extra information about the way to represent text?</li>
		</ul>
